If you work with technology in today's world I am sure you thought about
this sentence above a couple of times before. It seems every day, a new
technology that will change the way you do your job emerges, and you
have to learn a new skill to keep it up with the speed of change.
Believe me or not, that's a great thing!

We have a unique opportunity to learn something new on a daily basis and
improve the way we operate, develop new apps and do business. We are
broadening our knowledge and getting away from traditional silos, more
and more automation tools are making our life easier to manage
applications and developers are free to do what they do it better, which
is being creative.

My name is Gustavo Mantovan and I have been working with technology for
over 10 years now, mostly with Networking and Security, however this
blog is to show all the new technologies I am playing with and hopefully
being able to give you some cool tips and tricks.

When I am not geeking out, I really enjoy playing soccer, tennis and
plan for my next trip. Feel free to reach out in any social media to
give any feedback.
